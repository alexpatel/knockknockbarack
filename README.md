Knock Knock, Barack
================

'Knock Knock, Barack' uses order-1 and order-2 Markov models to generate jokes from Obama's political speeches. It constructs Knock-Knock, Yo Mama, and 'Why did the chicken cross the road?' jokes using the part-of-speech tagging functionality of the Natural Language Toolkit (http://nltk.org/). 

The application is hosted at: [knockknockbarack.com](knockknockbarack.com)(dead).
